Checking if there is new content in moodle and sending mail about it

In one of my courses, we got the option to get bonus points by checking the H.W submission of the entire class,
the first one that sending an email to the prof (only after he published the H.W) getting to check the H.W and getting the bonus points.

In this code, I made a program that login into my Moodle and check each 5 sec if there is new content on the submission part, if there is a new submission, my program sending an email to my prof that I want to check this H.W

Needless to say, I checked the first H.W that was published.
